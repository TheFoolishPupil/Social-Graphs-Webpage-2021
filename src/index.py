    "## Introduction"
    (
        "This website is set on presenting the insights gained from carrying"
        " out network and text analysis on top box office films. There are a"
        " few things we would ask you to keep in mind when using this site."
        " Firstly, it is important to point out that this is not a static site."
        " It is in fact quite the opposite, almost all of the graphs are dynamic;"
        " Hovering over a diagram reveals an entire toolset that you can  use to"
        " play around with the data. Similarly you can scroll around and explore"
        " the dataset in the Data Analysis section."
    )
    (
        "Since the page is so dynamic it will be a little slower to load the pages"
        " than if it was static, please have some patience. It will use your browsers"
        " cache so as you navigate pages it should become faster. In the siderbar"
        " you can find the page navigation as well as options to download the dataset"
        " and view the explainer notebook. All that being said, we hope you enjoy"
        " your time here and look forward to hearing your feedback üòÅ"
    )
    "## Motivation"
    (
        "The dataset we used to conduct our analysis is the set of films that"
        " grossed the highest revenue in the US box office for a given weekend"
        " from 2001 to 2021. We ultimately chose this dataset because we found"
        " it very compelling to see if we can draw any conclusions about what"
        " might bring success to a film. Are there certain specific actors, or"
        " groups of actors that seem to contribute to a films success to a large"
        " degree? Some genres of films are certainly more likely to be successfull"
        " than others."
    )
    (
        "These are the sorts of questions we hope to answer for ourselves, and"
        " convey in an effective way to any readers. We hope that this"
        " website in addition to the explainer notebook serve to provide insight"
        "  into our analysis and ilicit a desire to examine the anlysis closer."

    "# Text analysis of movie plots"

    "## Genre Most Popular Words"
    "By analyzing movie plots per genre, we are interested in seeing whether genres"
    " share any words, as well as what words make a genre unique. To do that we "
    " calculate the top frequent words in each genre (TF value) but also the top "
    " relevant words in each genre (TF-IDF value)."

        "As we can see there is a significant difference between TF and TF-IDF values."
        " TF (term frequency) gives us words that are often used in a document. In our "
        " dataset, for example, we can see that words like **kill, find, leave, attack,**"
        " **help, return** are appearing very often. This makes sense, since these are "
        " verbs that can generally describe a plot. However, these words are not very "
        " descriptive of the genres."
        "The IDF (inverse document frequency) of a word gives us the measure of how"
        " significant that term is between all genres because it takes into account "
        " the number of genres containing a term. Therefore, it mainly returns "
        " protagonist nameslike **katniss, voldemort, shrek, zuckerberg, gandalf** "
        " which help us get a better sense of a genre's movies."
        "Ideally, when using TF-IDF, we would want to get words that describe a genre"
        " more accurately, without seeing character names. Since we were unable to"
        " remove these names for more than 700 movies, they now dominate the dataset's"
